Tamagotchi

This was our final project of this course and we made a project that incorporated object-oriented programming. This project consisted of creating a Tamagotchi pet that could be interacted with. 

There were specific actions that we had to program that we used to interact with the pet such as:
* feeding the pet, in order to keep it from going hungry
* bathing the pet, when it gets dirty
* playing with the pet, to increase its happiness. 

Also, some other "rules" to this pet were:
* As the pet is successfully cared for, it will grow from an egg, to a baby, to a child, to an adult. 
* If the pet is consistently neglected, it will die. 

For more information on this project, please take a look at the pdf "Project 10 - Tamagotchi".
